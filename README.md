# This is a light mode fork of the Just Stoic extension

# Just-Stoic-Chrome_Ext

A new tab extension that helps you to enjoy the teachings of the 2000 plus year old stoic philosophy. Each day a new quote is displayed. The quotes are taken from the works of the stoic heavyweights Marcus Aurelius, Seneca and Epictetus. 

The extension has been designed to be minimalist with focus solely on the text. There are no background images of snowy mountain tops, no breaking news feeds and no links to social media. Just stoic quotes.

Available from the [Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/just-stoic/dankibpkafobfgcbegmnbpjhmlcfkmkg)
